# froxlorTools
Tools for the Froxlor admin panel

*froxlor-install.sh* - install froxlor with nginx and all dependencies on a fresh debian11
There are some scripts which shall install froxlor. They didn't work for me. So I collected all the useful infos from the web, put it in a bash-script and added my own stuff.

Fee free to help improving *froxlor-install.sh*
